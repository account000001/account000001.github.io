In the year 1980, God laid it upon this couple to start a children ministry that will serve as a link to bring children to the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Rev. Dr. Abiodun Sanu and his wife Rev. Dr. Mrs Abiola Sanu embarked on this journey to lead children in Nigeria in the way of righteousness and hope. Countless children outreaches were organized to the Glory of God. Although both founders are now resting in the bossom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the work of the Lord continues. Child Evangelism Team is comprised of believers who believe strongly that children can be nurtured in the way of truth and love through God's holy word.
