The vision of Child Evangelism Team was birthed in the year 1979, when the couple SANU had a burden to include praying for children in their daily prayers. This led them to start a Good News Club in their home at 14 Adejumo layout Iwo Road, Ibadan,Nigeria.They eventually set up a committee of believers who believe strongly in leading children to Christ on the 29th Semptember, 1980 to plan for a Children rally in November 22nd, 1980 at the Oritamefa Baptist Church Ibadan, Oyo State, Nieria. Many children were present at the rally and quite a number gave their lives to Jesus Christ. By 1981, several seminars where held in churches, christian organizations and institutions in and outside their homebase Ibadan. The Child Evangelism Team was registered with the Federal Government of Nigeria on December 12th 1983, becoming the first Children Ministry to be registered in Nigeria. The Board of trustees included Abiodun Olajire Sanu, Abiola Oyenike Sanu, Taiwo Babatunde Odede, Kehinde Olabayo Tubi, Patricia Joke Omibiyi, Joseph Ikenye, Gabriel Aderinola Adeoti. In the year 1984, three of the founding members were sent to Netherlands to attend a month long International course on Child Evangelism. They came back equiped with knowledge on improving the training of people to reach children for Christ. Membership of the Team is opened to christians from all denominations and groups. This because the team itself is interdenominational. The team is not a church but a service organisation that encourages its members to go back to their churches to impact the children with the undiluted word of God. Over the years God has helped Child Evangelism to make giant strides in the ministry to children in Nigeria and some parts of Africa. With frequent trips to the United States to buy Children Visual materials a lot of useful knowledge was gained on the trips which have been effective in reaching children to the glory of God. The founding father and mother of Child Evangelism Team Rev'd Dr. Abiodun Olajire Sanu and Rev'd Dr. Mrs. Abiola Sanu are now resting in the bossom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Their work however, lives after them and their children and the members have taken it upon themselves to take the work to greater heights through the everlasting grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
